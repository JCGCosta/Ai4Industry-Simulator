    "description": "DX10 filling workshop with a Cartesian robot, a filler (with a magnetic valve) attached to the Cartesian robot and a conveyor belt. The machine is configured such that: 1) once the optical sensor at the start of the belt detects an item, the magnetic valve of the filler opens and the Cartesian robot starts to move along the X axis (at the speed of the belt) above the item. 2) Once a preconfigured amount of product has been poured by the filler, the valve closes and the robot returns to its initial X coordinate at maximum speed while the item keeps moving towards the end of the conveyor.",
